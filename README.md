# The Pickle MOD - 1.12.2

Years ago, in the time of 1.7.10 I create a mod about pickles. It was a simple mod, for a simpler time. I used The Pickle Mod to teach myself the ways of Minecraft modding.  Now in the days of 1.12.2, my children have heard the tales of the magical pickles and their effects on the creatures of Minecraft.  So they asked that I bring forth the power of the pickle to their world.

The Pickle Mod has now been updated to 1.12.2,  I have used it, as before, to learn about all that has changed since 1.7.10 and I thought I would offer it to the modding community.

## Features

* New crop: cucumbers, seeds will fall from grass.
* New ore: Salt Blocks (registered with ore dict) appears in higher elevations.
* New food: Cucumber, heals 1/2 heart but add 6 saturation
* New crafted food: Pickle, heals 2 hearts, but takes away 2 saturation.
* Salt: mined from salt blocks used in recipes, but can be placed on the ground like redstone. 
* Flour: created from wheat, no purpose yet. 
* New AI: Un-dead mobs and Creepers fear salt and will not cross a line of it on the ground.  They will run away instead. Protect your base with a salt line.
* Pickle Sword: Very low durability, but can one-hit Creepers and Enderman with a high durability cost, does 4 damage to Zombie/Skeleton but takes no durability hit.  Does no damage to any other mobs, but will lose one durability.
* Pickle Bomb: Charge a pickle with redstone and you get a pickle bomb, throw it for deadly splash damage to Endermen, Creepers, and the Undead.
